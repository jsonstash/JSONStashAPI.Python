# JSONStashAPI.Python
This library takes what the JSONStash api returns in JSON, and converts it to Python objects for easy interaction with in Python projects.

I always liked seeing a SDK for a application in my language of choice. I am not fluent in every language, but thought it would be fun to try my hand at it. That being said anyone who would like to take on building it in said language is more than welcome to.
